        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Learn about our features.- Discovery of Radioactive Elements:
            - Polonium: Named after her homeland, Poland, this element emits alpha and beta particles.
            - Radium: Emits alpha particles and was used in radiation therapy.
        - Radioactivity Research:
            - Coined the term "radioactivity" to describe the emission of rays by uranium compounds.
            - Demonstrated that radioactivity is an atomic property, not a molecular interaction.
        - Portable X-ray Machine:
            - Invented during World War I to diagnose injuries near the battlefront.
            - Nicknamed "Little Curies," these units saved countless lives.
        - Radiation Therapy:
            - Pioneered the use of high doses of radiation to treat cancer.</p>

            ## Early Life
- Born to Science teachers Bronislawa and Wladyslaw
- Mother died when Marie was ten
- Completed high school at 15, obtaining a medal for best student
- Interested in science from an early age

## Career
- Left Russia in 1891 to study at the University of Paris
- Discovered radioactive elements polonium and radium
- First woman to win a Nobel Prize and first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields (physics and chemistry)
- Founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw for medical research. Marie Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields (physics and chemistry). Her work paved the way for advancements in medicine, energy, and scientific research.</p>
